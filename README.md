# Weather-app 
**A weather dashboard is a user-friendly application that provides real-time weather information and forecasts, often incorporating interactive elements and customizable features. These dashboards typically display current conditions like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, as well as upcoming forecasts, potentially including severe weather alerts and historicalÂ data.**

A weather dashboard using an API typically functions as an application that retrieves and displays weather information for specified locations. The core of such a dashboard lies in its interaction with a third-party weather API.
